title: What is your "Handprint"?
---

There is a non-profit called [80’000 hours](https://80000hours.org/). They are an organisation focusing on making a difference in one's working life. Their career guide starts like this:

> You’ll spend about 80,000 hours working in your career: 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, for 40 years. So how to spend that time is one of the most important decisions you’ll ever make.
>
> Choose wisely, and you will not only have a more rewarding and interesting life — you’ll also be able to help solve some of the world’s most pressing problems. But how should you choose.
> <cite>[80'000 hours Career Guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/introduction/)</cite>

They propose a framework:

> We think the impact you can have in different careers is driven by three main factors:
> 1. How **pressing the problems are** that you focus on
> 2. The **scale of the contribution** the path lets you make to tackling those problems
> 3. Your **personal fit** for the path
>
> <cite>[80'000 hours Advanced Series](https://80000hours.org/make-a-difference-with-your-career/)</cite>

I think there are convincing arguments to made, some of which are in this guide, that working on transforming the way we produce food is a pressing problem on a large scale. Equally convincing is the argument that you will be able to have a bigger impact by spending your working life on a problem than by most other means you can think of. Besides considering the footprint of your actions, think about your handprint - the impact of your work.

Factory farming is one of the most pressing problems they have identified. Their reasoning takes mostly a moral perspective. If you are interested, read their explanation: <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/" target="_blank">Factory farming</a>
