title: The inefficiency of feeding animals
---

## Key Ideas

- Animals need energy to live, so feeding animals plants to then eat the animal always comes with an inefficiency.
- Worldwide about 66% of the total crop supply is used for human food. <sup>[[World Resource Institute]](https://research.wri.org/sites/default/files/2019-07/WRR_Food_Full_Report_0.pdf#page=26.00)</sup> 

All living beings need to get their energy from somewhere. Considering multi-cellular life there are:

1. Producers (Plants): Get energy from the sun by doing photosynthesis.
2. Primary Consumers (Herbivores - Animals): Consume plants and get energy from the structures they have built.
3. Secondary and Tertiary Consumers (Carnivores - Animals): Eat other animals that have either eaten plants or other animals.

Every form of life needs energy to stay alive: Moving around, eating and processing food, and so on. Energy that is used for these purposes will not be available for the next level of the food chain later. As a rule of thumb 10% of energy is lost in every step of the way.

Humans are special in the sense that we eat both plants and animals. Considering a very simple example then:

- If we eat a plant then we get 100% of the energy
- If we eat an animal that ate that plant we only get 10% of the energy, while the other 90% were used by the animal during its lifetime.

This means eating animals is always coupled with an inherent energy inefficiency. As you can see in this plot, this depends on the animal. Chicken are the most efficient animal "in turning feed into meat while beef or sheep" waste a lot more energy. <q>As a rule of thumb: smaller animals are more efficient. That's why chicken and fish tend to have a lower environmental impact.</q><sup>[[Hannah Ritchie]](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets#:~:text=As%20a%20rule%20of%20thumb%3A,have%20a%20lower%20environmental%20impact.)</sup>

There is more nuance when accounting for the fact, that not all animal feed could also be eaten by humans. While this is the case for grass, we produce a lot of cereal and soy and large parts of them are fed to animals. If we produce 1000kcal of soy and feed it to a cow, we only get roughly 10 kcal of meat from it. This means we have to produce 100 times as much soy, which means 100 times the amount of land, 100 times the amount of work, 100 times the amount of GHG — and that's not even considering the work it takes to keep the animals.

The following are two visualistations of what this means for the current food system.

> On a per meal basis, chicken is the least climate change inducing meat and it causes 40 times as much climate change per calorie of protein relative to legumes like soy and peas. So it is a massive direct climate impact.
