title: How Much Food Will We Need in the Future?
---

## Key Ideas

- Because of population growth, current undernourishment, and changing diets there is a "food-gap", meaning we do not produce as much food as will be needed in a few decades.
- How large this "food-gap" is depends among other factors on diet composition, consumed calories, food waste.

When considering our food needs in the future we have to consider two key elements:

1.  Population Growth: Which is projected to peak at just over 10 billion in 2066.

2. Producing enough to eat for all people that are already undernourished in the present. Worldwide about 1 in 10 people does not have enough to eat.

Together with the increase in demand for "resource-intensive foods" (LINK to CHOICE) this creates a “Food Gap” of about 56% of our current calorie production in a “business as usual scenario”. The calories listed include “all crops intended for direct human consumption, animal feed, industrial uses, seeds, and biofuels.” <sup>[[WRI]](https://research.wri.org/wrr-food/scope-challenge-and-menu-possible-solutions-synthesis#:~:text=Includes%20all%20crops%20intended%20for,industrial%20uses%2C%20seeds%2C%20and%20biofuels.)</sup>

> Frequent claims that the world already has an overabundance of food and could meet future needs without producing more food are based on an unrealistic, even if desirable, hypothetical. It presumes that the world [...] eliminates nearly all meat consumption [by 2050]; that people shift from meat to vegetables and legumes and consume the same high-yield crops now used for animal feed; that all food loss and waste is eliminated; and that food is distributed just enough and no more than to meet nutritional needs of every person in the world.

It stands to reason, that there will have to be an increase in food production in the next decades. The 56% are just one scenario however. Even if it is unreaslistic to implement the above mentioned measures to an extent that closes this gap completely, even implementing them partially will reduce the challenge.

> The more the gap can be closed through demand-reduction measures, the smaller will be the challenge of increasing food production. And as that challenge decreases, so does the risk that the world will fail to meet food needs, which would most harshly affect the poor.

1. Food Waste: See Article on Food Waste
2. Reducing Meat Consumption: See Article on EAT-Lancet Diet
3. A reduction of calorie above the “healthy amount”. There is a rising trend of obesity, which goes hand in hand with an overconsumption of calories, calories that somebdoy else could eat.

To see how a healthy consumption of calories fits into a bigger picture of reducing the emissions of the food system, read this analysis of a paper that finds that it could help reduce food related emissions by 30%:
