title: How do farm animals emit greenhouse gases?
---

## Key Ideas:

- Some farm animals (cows, sheeps) are emitting methane as a result of their digestion.
- About 30% of global methane emissions come from this source.
- There does not seem to be a way to eliminate these emissions while still keeping them as farm animals.

When comparing the climate impact of animal foods, you might have noticed, that the one of cow products is significantly higher than the one of pigs or chicken for example. Part of that is attributable to the stems from the difference in energy efficiency which depends on body size (more on that HERE). Another part though is the digestion system of cattle and other ruminating animals (sheep for example).

Rumination has evolved to be able to digest very fiber rich plants, like gras, which single-chamber stomach animals cannot utilise. The end of this process involves methane producing microbes. The cow then burps this methane into the atmosphere. 

> The problem becomes more apparent considering the sheer scale of livestock raised for meat production throughout the world. A single cow produces between 154 to 264 pounds of methane gas per year. Not counting for the emissions of any other livestock, 1.5 billion cattle, raised specifically for meat production worldwide, emit at least 231 billion pounds of methane into the methane into the atmosphere each year.

In the chart we get an overview of global methane emissions. As you can see most of them stem from the agricultural sector and within it most are from rumination:

</a>

There are some feed additives which can reduce the methane production of a cow. This however is not a silver bullet and will not be able to remove this element of emissions completely.

> [In a 2006 Climate Change Document by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation] with mitigation ideas, which are the same that are being discussed now 20 years later, and they have done some good but not very much because there is not an economic incentive for any of them. If you are following you might read about methane mitigation through changing the feed or by adding seawead. The best case of the IPCC says that the most we could hope for from all of those interventions combined is 200 Mt of mitigation. We are going to have 1.3 billion more Gt of rumenant methane in 2050 because there are going to be more animals.
