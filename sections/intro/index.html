Our food system contributes roughly 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
This guide tries to answer the following questions:
</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Where do these emissions come from?</li>
<li>What approaches could be taken to reduce them?</li>
<li>How can I get involved in this transition?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Start by understanding why the emissions of the global food system
are so important to reaching our climate targets:
