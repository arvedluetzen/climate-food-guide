I built this project as a final project for "Communicating Climate Change" a course I took during my exchange semester at the University of Toronto. My goal was to find a new and better way of introducing people to the area of sustainable food systems by providing a guided yet individual learning experience through a website.

Thank you [Hanna Morris](https://hannamorris.com/) for teaching this course and all my classmates for giving feedback during my progress presentation.

This project lives on GitHub: [Climate Food Guide on GitHub](https://github.com/arvedluetzen/climate-food-guide)

## Disclaimer

- This is a guide for people who accept that climate change is a real, pressing problem and want to learn more about ways to do something about it. I will not argue these basic ideas.
- I am conciously only focusing on the climate aspect of food. I know and am highly convinced of other reasons like health and animal rights lead to similar action steps and support the arguments of transitioning away form animal agriculture.
- The short explanations I write are based on the readings I provide. I try to only include as much as is needed for the core of the argument to work and leave all further information to the source.
- I know that there is a lot more nuance to everything and so should you. My goal is to get general ideas and ways of thinking across.
