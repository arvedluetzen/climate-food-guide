title: What Are Alternative Proteins?
---

## Key Ideas:

- If it is almost impossible to convince people at scale to eat differently, we can also try to produce what they eat without the bad environemntal impacts.
- Alternative Proteins is the umbrella term for products that try to produce meat without animals thus avoiding many of the negative effects.
- This can be seen as a parallel approach to solar panels or electric car. They are still electricity and a car, just better.


> We really do need the innovation. We need alternative proteins. The one thing that has worked in energy is not “don’t consume” but mitigate the emissions of the consumption. And we need that also in agriculture or our climate goals will be impossible.

The premise is: Find a way to make meat just without inefficiencies (link), methane (link animals), and slaughter. Short, without animals. As Bruce Friedrich the founder of the Good Food Institute puts it:

> It’s literally: Let’s biomimic the precise meat experience but do it with plants and instead of the ineffiencies of growing massive amounts of crops so we can feed them to animals so we can eat cells, let’s feed the cells directly. [...] the processes require a fraction of the land, cause a fraction of the adverse climate impacts, and are just far more efficient.

There is good reason to believe that this approach could be the next solar panel: A green technology that is better and cheaper than it's fossil predecessors.

> What we work on is not alternatives to meat, just as an electric car is not an alternative to a car and solar and wind energy are not alternatives to energy.  We are not focused on plant based meat that requires that people like something they don’t like. We’re literally focused on the science of perfectly biomimmicing the meat experience with plants, so that the two products are indistinguishable. But because the plant based product is more efficient it can actually cost less. So you sit down and have two options. To you they are identical, the plant based product costs less and is healthier.

If we would actually achieve this, same or better taste at lower cost, it could be a scalable solution to the problems faced when trying to get people to shift diets (link).

> What a great situation if you have the potential to create a new product, that has the same characteristics and bring additional benefits. So, you don’t have to care or worry about: “Is the consumer in the mass market aware of climate impacts or not?
> <cite>[Peter Schniering on the Effektiv Spenden Podcast around 33:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BQFsMqzMbmBugVE34O5IL?si=82d4041b2b8747ae)</cite>

The effect of making meat without animals is similar to shifting dietary patterns on paper. Both result in a reduction of the adverse effects of producing meat. The dietary shift approach thinks in terms of no longer eating meat while the idea of alternative proteins is to find a new way of producing meat.

> One of the things that really works for alternative meat […] We are not the people telling you to eat less meat or no meat. We think it is fine if you eat meat and if you really love meat, then that is what we are here for. It is to help to make the meat better, healthier, less resource intensive, less expensive etc. […] We do sometimes hear people say: “Oh I am a meat eater, that’s not for me.” and we have to say “Well, we are not trying to create more options for vegetarians. We don’t care what vegetarians eat. If you are a meat eater than that is absolutely for you.”

Bruce Friedrich has founded the "Good Food Institute", a non-profit with the mission of scaling alternative proteins globally:
