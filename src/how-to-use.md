For those who are now sure how to start, here is a little introduction of how to use this guide.

This guide has 4 sections in which you will gradually go from problem to action:

1. Why do we care: Setting the stage by realising how big the climate impact of food production is.
2. Understanding the problem: Get an understanding of where emissions come from.
3. Approaches to solutions: Think of possible ways emissions could be approached.
4. Action: Change comes from action. After thinking of the problem and solutions, I want to inspire you to also consider being active in this transition.

To explore these topics I have one piece of advice: Just click on whatever interests you and read. The boxes of the diagrams all lead to more detailed explanations of what they are supposed to represent. In these articles you will find summarized key ideas, lots of charts (which are all clickable and will lead you to their source), and lists of media if you want to learn  more.
