title: What is CO2-eq and why is it important in food systems?
---

## Key Ideas:

- Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas like CO2 which is especially present in agriculture.
- Different molecules have different effects on short term and long term warming of the climate.
- CO2-eq tries to standardize other gases into the equivalent amount of CO2.


When talking about GHG emissions it is important to consider that there is not only CO2 but also methane, nitrous oxide, and others. This is where the term “CO2-eq” comes from. It is the attempt to express the different ways these gases affect the climate in terms of CO2 so we can have one number to express total emissions. This has led to the following standard conversions:

- 1 kg of Methane (CH4) = 28 kg of CO2 (100 year global warming potential)
- 1 kg nitrous oxide (N2O) = 298 kg of CO2 (100 year global warming potential)

There is a very important nuance to consider here that is especially relevant in regards to methane (and thus the food sector): On what time horizon do we make the comparison?

This is important because while CO2 stays in the atmosphere for 300 to 1000 years, methane only persists for about a decade. The numbers I listed above is looking at how much warming is created over 100 years. All of the methane’s warming effect happened in the first decade of this. Using the factor of 28 thus greatly underestimates its effects in the short term future. We have set climate targets until the year 2050, so how potent is methane in that time horizon?

- 1 kg of Methane (CH4) = 84 kg of CO2 (20 year global warming potential)

These considerations lead to the following effects:

- Rising Emissions: More CO2 compounds and thus the warming rises exponentially.
- Constant Emissions: Adding a constant amount of new CO2 leads to a constant increase in warming while CH4 settles at some level where new emissions are equal to the degrading.
- Falling Emissions: No more CO2 emissions mean CO2 levels stay constant and warming stays constant. Methane however will be out of the atmosphere quite quickly and no longer contribute to warming.
