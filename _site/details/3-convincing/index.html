    <p>THIS IS NOT THE FINISHED ARTICLE!</p>
<p>As I already had collected many quotes and resources to support my argument but did not manage to tie them together in a nice way, I asked ChatGPT to write a template article, so you can get a sense of what will be argued here:</p>
<h2>Key Ideas:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persuasion doesn’t scale</strong> when it requires sacrifice.</li>
<li><strong>Political systems avoid unpopular measures</strong>, especially on food.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioural change is low-leverage</strong>, requiring massive effort for small gains.</li>
<li><strong>Past attempts failed</strong>, even under high climate awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Global demand is rising</strong>, especially in places not receptive to climate messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioural change can help at the margins, but it will never scale to the level needed for meaningful global emissions reductions in the food system.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Convincing the World to Eat Less Meat Won’t Scale</h2>
<p>Across climate communication, behavioural science, and policy experience, the same pattern keeps showing up: <strong>appeals to individual lifestyle change rarely scale globally</strong>, especially when they require giving something up. The quotes below illustrate several reinforcing reasons.</p>
<h2>1. Persuasion doesn't work on people who don’t want to change</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“My rule has never been to try and convince people that don’t want to be convinced, because all you are going to do is fight: I am right, you’re wrong.”<br>
<cite>Simon Sinek (YouTube Video)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meat is culturally embedded, emotionally charged, convenient, affordable, and enjoyable. Trying to persuade billions of people—across different cultures, income levels, and food traditions—to voluntarily reduce it creates resistance rather than mass adoption.</p>
<h2>2. Asking people to sacrifice is politically unpopular</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Many will think that people need to take responsibility and ‘give stuff up’… Maybe that’s true. But it doesn’t change the fact that it’s politically unpopular, and will make decarbonisation a constant and polarising battle.”<br>
<cite>Sustainability by Numbers</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Telling people to “give stuff up,” including meat, reliably produces backlash. Politicians know this—so they avoid making meat reduction a policy priority. Without political support, behaviour-change strategies remain niche.</p>
<h2>3. Individual change does not scale globally</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“I would be very surprised if effort put into personal change… scales globally. Even if you get all of Germany or all of Denmark to change fundamentally, the emission reduction is not going to be that great.”<br>
<cite>Effektiv Spenden (1:15)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the world’s future meat consumption growth comes from lower-income countries where rising incomes drive demand for animal protein. These consumers do <strong>not</strong> respond to climate messaging in the same way wealthy Europeans might. Their priorities are price, nutrition, and status—not emissions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The world is not full of rich Europeans that can massively change their consumption behaviours.”<br>
<cite>Effektiv Spenden (1:20)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>4. We already tried telling the world to eat less meat — and it didn’t work</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommendations in 2006 to reduce meat intake “have done some good but not very much because there is not an economic incentive… Telling people not to eat meat… might have helped some, but we are 40% up (104 Mt more meat today than in 2006).”<br>
<cite>Effektiv Spenden (~1:02)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite two decades of campaigns, documentaries, school programs, and global awareness, global meat production rose dramatically. If this strategy didn’t scale during the <em>most intense</em> period of climate attention, it is unlikely to ever scale.</p>
<h2>5. Behavioural interventions are effortful and low-leverage</h2>
<p>Behavioural change approaches—education, nudges, defaults—can work locally, but their impact is limited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The good motivation to focus on behavioural change would be: ‘Focusing on behavioural change gets us the most emission reduction for a given amount of effort.’”<br>
<cite>Effektiv Spenden (1:20)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet the evidence suggests the opposite: behavioural change requires huge effort and yields relatively small impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even in the best of times, there was not climate policy that was successful that was predicated on the idea that the majority of people would actually want to change their lifestyle.”<br>
<cite>Effektiv Spenden (59:30)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If lifestyle-based policies didn’t work when climate concern was at its peak, they won’t work as a global strategy.</p>
<h2>6. Public support for meat-reduction policies is extremely low</h2>

<img src="/assets/img/3-solutions/favor-meat-policies.png" alt="Chart detailing public support of policies with the goal of reducing meat consumption">
</a>
<p>Surveys consistently show that support for policies directly aimed at reducing meat consumption is very low. This mirrors the political and behavioural obstacles: people simply do not want to be pushed to eat less meat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know that’s not always a popular view. Many will think that people need to take responsibility and “give stuff up” or sacrifice some comfort. Maybe that’s true. But it doesn’t change the fact that it’s politically unpopular, and will make decarbonisation a constant and polarising battle.

<blockquote>
<p>I would be very suprised if effort put into personal change, which simply just doesn’t scale globally - like even if you can get all of Germany or all of Denmark or all of any other European country, which is really the only place in the world where there is a lot of care about climate change. If you get all of them to change fundamentally, the emission reduction is not going to be that great.

<blockquote>
<p>[In a 2006 Climate Change Document by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation] with mitigation ideas, which are the same that are being discussed now 20 years later, and they have done some good but not very much because there is not an economic incentive for any of them. [Talking about Methane Mitigation by Feeding - Article] The other intervention from 200= was telling people not to eat meat or eat less meat which sort of analogizes to people need to make changes for the climate now. I am sure some people did and it might now be even worse if not for that messaging but we are 40% up (104 Mt more meat today than in 2006) […] So far the most of the climate community continues to be: […] and let’s encourage less or no meat even though those have not scaled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Effektiv Spenden 1:02 or so - slightly adapted for readability</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In ARTICLE we have seen the impact a different diet could have on the emissions. The question that remains is: Can we get there and if so how?</p>
<p>Diet largely comes down to the behaviour of individuals. There are many ways one could consider influencing somebody’s behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educating them (books, flyers, conversations, …)</li>
<li>Changing defaults (conferences, canteens, …)</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s look at if these are effective measures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If somebody makes an argument: “We need behavioural change to hit X or Y emission target.” Then that is not a good justification to focus on behavioural change. The good motivation to focus on behavioural change would be: “Focusing on behavioural change gets us the most emission reduction for a given amount of effort.” Effektiv Spenden 1:20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an underlying problem with all of them though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it is kind of clear that even in the best of times, there was not climate policy that was successful that was kind of strongly predicated on the idea that the majority of people would actually want to change their lifestyle. This hasn’t worked when we had the most attention on climate that we ever had. - Effektiv Spenden 59:30</p>

<p>My conclusion is that behavioural change can help but will never become a scalable approach to reduce emissions in a larger sense.</p>
