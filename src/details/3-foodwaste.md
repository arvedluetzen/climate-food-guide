title: How much food are we throwing away?
---

## Key Ideas:

- Food waste accounts for 6% of total global emissions and about 1/4 of global food emissions.
- Halving food waste could reduce food emissions by 27% until 2100.
- Even if we reduce food waste, there is still a need to find emissions free food production processes.

That reducing food waste makes sense is straight forward. Producing food that never nourishes anybody is an inefficiency that leads to unnecessary expenditure of resources and emissions. Shockingly this accounts for 6% of global GHG emissions. Not 6% of food emissions, global emissions. It is almost a quarter of the emissions of the food sector. This means we could nourrish another 2 billion people with the amount of food we are producing at the moment or scale back production and still have enough to eat.

> If food waste was a country it would be the third largest emitter, beaten only by China and the US.
> <cite>[Hannah Ritchie on Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/food-emissions-carbon-budget#:~:text=If%20food%20waste%20was%20a,by%20China%20and%20the%20US.)</cite>

Eliminating food waste would have the same effect as reducing the emissions of the US by 50%!<sup>[[OWID]](https://ourworldindata.org/food-waste-emissions#:~:text=Or%2C%20if%20we%20were%20to,United%20States%20(13%25)%20emitted%20more.)</sup> Speaking of North America: There 42% of all food is lost or wasted. This is almost double that of any other part of the world as you can see in this chart:

I think there are two things to keep in mind when seeing these numbers:

- Eliminating food waste does not change the general food system though it makes the challenge easier. (ARTICLE: Multiply by Zero) We have to replace less emitting processes, but we still have to find ways to make each of them non-emitting.
- This will make more food available which is critical in the context of undernourishment and a growing population. (ARTICLE: Undernourishment)
