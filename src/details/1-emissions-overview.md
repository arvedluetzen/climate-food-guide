title: Food System Emissions
---

## Key Ideas

- Global Food production is responsible for 25% - 35% of GHG Emissions
- Business as usual food emissions alone would leave us with a 67% chance of staying below 2 degrees of warming.

The global CO2-eq emissions (see this explanation) of the food system are around 30% of the total emissions or 15 billion tonnes of CO2-eq every year. To get an estimate for this number, researchers try to decompose emissions from the complete value chain and add them up. As you can see in the first graph there are differences between approximations. You can also get a first impression for which parts of the food production process contribute how much to the overall emissions.

What does this share of food related emissions mean for achieving our climate goals? Using population growth estimates together with some other metrics it is possible to calculate the total emissions until 2100. Comparing number to the carbon budget for reaching 1.5 or 2 degrees it becomes apparent that even if we eliminated all other sources of emissions, our food would still emit enough CO2-eq to have a 67% chance of staying below 2 degrees. If we want to increase that chance we have to change something to emit less than the business usual scenario. "Ignoring food emissions is simply not an option if we want to get close to our international climate targets." (Hannah Ritchie - Article 2)
