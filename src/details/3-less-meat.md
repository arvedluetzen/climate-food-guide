title: What would happen if we reduced meat consumption?
---

## Key Ideas

- The EAT-Lancet Diet was developed based on research to optimise for environmental and human health.
- If it were the average diet on earth it would reduce food related greenhous gas emissions by almost 50%


As we have seen (LINK ARTICLE), animal products generally have a lot higher emissions per calorie or gram of protein than food from plants. A very straightforward to reducing emissions could be to increase the share of plants in diets a lot. Researchers have proposed a diet “to balance the goals of healthy nutrition and environmental sustainability for a global population.” Below you can see how its contents would compare to the average diet of some countries.

As you might have noticed: The EAT-Lancet diet contains a lot less animal products. Just how much you can see in the next chart.

> For most people in rich and middle-income countries, this would mean a reduction in meat and dairy consumption, but it does not eliminate all animal products completely. For many low-income countries, where meat consumption is low, this would actually mean an increase.

What would happen to the emissions of the global food system, if this diet would be the average diet on earth? It would half them!

Considering all emissions from the food sector in a business as usual scenario and comparing it to a scenario where the only change is this shift in dietary pattern we would emit 48% less <sup>[[OWID]](https://ourworldindata.org/food-emissions-carbon-budget)</sup>. This sounds absolutely fantastic and shows just how impactful the choice of food is. The open question here is: Can we get there and if so how?

All of this has another layer to it: If we ate less animals, we would need less land, which, depending on how it is used, could absorb CO2 and help mitigate climate change:

The 48% reduction number comes from a paper which Hannah Ritchie wrote an article about on Our World in Data:
