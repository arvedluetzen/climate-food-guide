title: What foods do and will people want to eat?

## Key Ideas:

- There is a strong trend that higher income leads to higher amount of meat consumption.
- There is a continued strong increase in meat consumption projected as more humans escape poverty.


When looking at the evolution of meat production, there is an unmistakable trend: We went from about 71 to 363 million tons in the time from 1961 to 2023 <sup>[[Our World in Data]](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production)</sup>. That is a an increase by over 500%. The world’s population only increased by 250%, from 3 to 8 billion, in the same time <sup>[[Our World in Data]](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/population-and-demography?facet=none&hideControls=false&indicator=Population&Sex=Both+sexes&Age=Total&Projection+scenario=None&country=CHN~USA~OWID_WRL~CAN~IND~UNM49_EUR)</sup>. This means that meat production per capita has doubled within 60 years.

When looking for the places where most meat is eaten, we find that as a general trend more wealthy nations (measured by GDP) also consume more meat.

There are differences in the diets and food’s role in culture between nations. Most high income countries today have a similar cultural background. It is thus not unreasonable to assume that this observation holds as a general rule. To check this, researchers have grouped countries based on their economic development and plotted their meat consumption over time. This paints a clear picture. Though these economic trends happened at different points in time, the trend looks very similar. The richer a a nation gets, the more meat is eaten.

This explains why projections for meat production until 2050 show no decline in the annual growth of meat production:
