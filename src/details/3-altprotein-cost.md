title: How Close Far Behind Meat Are Alternative Proteins in Price and Taste?
---

## Key Ideas:

- For plant-based meat consumers have to pay an average 82% premium over the animal counterpart.
- Even though there are some alternative proteins that 40% of people consider equal or better than meat, there are still many products where the alternative is not yet compeditive taste wise.


Whenever we try to replace an existing technology by a green one, no matter if it is meat or electric cars, there are two crucial elements to consider (LINK article Would Eat?):

- To what extent is the “green” option able to fulfil the same function?
- How much more does the consumer have to pay to get the “green” version of the product?

To be able to really scale something these two have to be achieved. (This does not yet take into account societal factors that also influence adoption.) So, where is the alternative protein industry at the moment?

## Price

As you can see there is a rather substantial premium consumers have to pay to switch to plant based meat.

## Taste

Even at the current stage where these products have not been on the market for very long there are categories where more than 40% of people prefer the plant based alternative or at least consider it and meat equal.

Over the whole range of product categories there are still large taste gaps to be closed though.
