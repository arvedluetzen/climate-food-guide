## Key Insight:

- For systemic change to happen, individuals have to show that they are willing to take part.
- By being an early adopter you help new ways of doing things get closer to mass market success.


> No, you’re not going to solve climate change by swapping your beefburger for a meat substitute one. But your impact is also a bit higher than the carbon savings of your burger alone. When we buy products like meat substitutes we’re sending a signal to the market — to existing companies and new innovators — that there is demand. It’s like waving a flag for businesses to come and serve us with low-carbon products. This not only attracts new innovators and companies to build better products, but it also allows existing ones to scale and drives the cost down.

There needs to be big systemic change which also means the economy will have to change. New markets, like alternative proteins, can only grow if there are people who buy their things - even if they are not yet cheaper or taste as good.

> My religion for new ideas has been the law of diffusion of innovation. […] In every population you are going to have a standard deviation. You are going to have high performers, low performers, and an average. Always. […] [The law of diffusion says that] the first 2.5% of any population are going to be your big idea people, your innovators. The next 12.5% are your early adopters. These are the people who are very comfortable spending time, money, and energy to be part of something that reflects their own beliefs. […] Then you have the majority, the 68%: more cynical, more practical, “what is in it for me?”, “will I get my money back?”. Then you have your laggers, the last 16%, the only reason they make any change is because they don’t have any other choice any more. The law of diffusion says that if you want to achieve mass market success or acceptance for any product, you have to achieve between 15 and 18% of market penetration. Then there is a social phenomenon that happens called a tipping point: It just goes. And the reason is very simple: The early majority will not try something until somebody else has tried it first.

If you want to see change happen, then be the early adopter. You are part of the population and though you are just one out of Millions, you can help drive society closer to the tipping point.
