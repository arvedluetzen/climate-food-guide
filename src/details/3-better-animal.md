title: Reducing Emissions from Animal Agriculture
---

THIS IS NOT THE FINISHED ARTICLE!

I have not done any research into this topic yet. I came across some things but I would need to know more. It has to adress mainly ideas of how to mitigate methane emissions from ruminant farm animals. There are ideas of how to do this, so I would look at what the potential reductions are.

- Feeding additives - can only get us so far

• **Best farm practices**. We know that there are [large differences in food emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat) for a given food product depending on where and how it is produced. This is true for crops and livestock. Clearly farming practices matter. This scenario is one in which the average emissions intensity (emissions per unit of food) falls by 40% through improved practices (e.g. fertilizer management) and technology improvements (e.g. targeted fertilizers or additives to cattle feed).
